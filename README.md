# SP-Terrorism-Data
This repository contains all the files needed to run a Shiny application to visualize terrorism data.  First you need to download all
the files and save them in a new file.  

Next, you need to download required packages in R, including shiny, ggvis, and rworldmap.

The application should be able to run if you have downloaded everything correctly in R!
